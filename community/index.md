Juno Community
==============

There are various outlets to talk to other people about Juno, and get help when you need it:

* GitHub – see [about](/about) to find source for the various plugins
* [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/juno) – for questions, discussion and news
* [Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/one-more-minute/Julia-LT) – Mainly for development discussion, but questions are fine too
* [Julia Users Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-users) – questions about Juno and Julia in general are welcome here
