### Files & The Workspace

Go to View->Workspace (or use the "Toggle Workspace" command) to see a list of files you're working with (which will be empty by default). Add files by dragging them in or right clicking and selecting "Add File/Folder". On OS X I recommend the [Opener](https://github.com/eldargab/LT-Opener) plugin.

Press `C-O` to open the fuzzy file finder, which will search through files in your workspace as you type – this is really useful.

### Tabs & Tabsets

You can view tabs side by side by right clicking on a tab and clicking "Move tab into a new tabset". Drag and drop tabs to move them. Right click on the blank area next to the last tab to close that tabset.
