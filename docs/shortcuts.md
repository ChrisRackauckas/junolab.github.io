`C` = `Ctrl` (Windows, Linux), `Cmd` (Mac)

* `Ctrl-d`: Toggle docs
* `Ctrl-m`: Toggle methods
* `C-/`: Toggle comment
* `C-Enter`: Evaluate current block
* `C-Shift-Enter`: Evaluate whole file
* `Ctrl-Space`: Open the command
* `C-Shift-T`: Re-open the last closed tab (this will restore any unsaved work, and works even after restarts).

Place the cursor on a function name and press `Ctrl-D` or `Ctrl-M` to toggle docs and methods for that function, as above.

All of Juno and Light Table's features are available through the command bar, so if you're stuck on how to do something that's always the best place to start. If you need any help feel free to open an issue.
